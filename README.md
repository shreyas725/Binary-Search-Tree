******************************************************Binary-Search-Tree*************************************************************

The Binary Search Tree is constructed in the following order wherein it reads three lines from standard in.

1) The first two lines are a single integer, two nodes in a binary search tree. The third line is a whitespace-delimited list of integers. 

Example:
4
2
8 7 13 6 2 5 1 9 11 3 4 10

2) It will then construct a binary search tree, in order, from the integers in line 3.

3) Further, it will calculate and show the distance between the nodes in line 1 and 2, or print "not found".
